Title: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Description:

This project revolves around the prediction of hotel booking cancellations using a dataset containing various features related to hotel bookings. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can effectively anticipate whether a booking is likely to be canceled. 

Key Steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project begins with the loading of the dataset, which includes details such as lead time, arrival date, booking changes, and customer information. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, ensuring a clean and usable dataset for analysis.

2. Model Training: The RandomForestClassifier is selected for its capability to handle complex relationships within the data. The model is trained on the processed dataset to learn the patterns associated with booking cancellations.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the metric to determine its effectiveness in predicting booking cancellations.

4. Visualizations: Visualizations are generated to provide insights into the distribution of canceled and non-canceled bookings. Additionally, a feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the key factors influencing booking cancellations.

5. Project Presentation: The project concludes with a simple presentation summarizing the key aspects of the analysis. This includes the project overview, the model's accuracy, insights from the visualizations, and suggestions for further analysis and data collection.

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations, which can assist hotel management in optimizing their booking strategies and improving customer satisfaction.
